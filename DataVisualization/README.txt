Welcome to this lesson on multivariate exploration.

We hope you are enjoying the lesson so far! We wanted to let you know that the code shown in the demonstration videos can easily be accessed through the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the lesson demo workspace.

To find these Jupyter Notebooks, simply click the Jupyter icon above and locate the corresponding notebook for each topic. 

This will help you follow along with the videos and practice with the code examples as you progress through the lesson.

Happy learning!
